- Identifying the best NYC restaurants for professional meetings using public data

## Why did I do this project?
- Wanted to practice data collection, filtering and ranking. Real-world use case: helping professinals find quiet, productive meetings spots in NYC.

## Where did the data come from?
- Manually searched Google Maps / Yelp / OpenTable for restaurants in Manhattan + Brooklyn. Compiled 74 candidates.

## Tools & Skills Used
- Excel: filtering, sorting, conditional formatting, pivot tables, ranking formulas

## Process
1. Searched and collected ~74 restaurants based on criteria (queit, private rooms, Wi-Fi, business hours, etc.
2. Created scoring system (e.g., 1-5 scale for noise level, price, convenience)
3. Built summary table with pros/cons, price range, counts
## Key Outputs
